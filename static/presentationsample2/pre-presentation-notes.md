# Notes for PMC Presentation

## PMC Charge

* To identify, understand, and address the challenges of pathologists and their practices
* To provide strategies, resources, and education to assist pathologists in developing, improving, and managing successful practices in current and evolving environments
* To engage member practices providing a pathway to connect them with the CAP's practice management resources

### Activities of Committee

* Develop practice tools and resources to support the Transformation Strategy
* Develop, review, and updated Just-in-Time practice management tools to meet the day-to-day and practical operational needs of CAP member practices
* Create and distribute [laboratory medical directips][]

### Before Meeting

* Identified content definitions
  1. Value Based Care
  2. Business of Pathology
  3. Planning and Risk Management
  4. People Management
  5. Measuring Productivity
  6. Change Management
* From this, distilled top two areas to develop content around:
  1. Value-Based Care:
    * Defining, measuring, and demonstrating value
    * Actual case studies - examples
    * What is the pathologist role in VBC?
    * The most desirable subset of value-based care was to focus on "actual case studies"
  2. Business of Pathology:
    * Description of different areas of practice management
    * Glossary of terms
    * Billing/CPT crib sheet
    * Highest ranking subset of "business of pathology" was "Glossary of Terms"


### New Process for PMC

1. Value-Based Care and Business of Pathology are first content areas to be developed



### Questions for Monique

1. How does she suggest we approach creating a "glossary?"
2. Since the NIPC is going to be in charge of reviewing and providing feedback for the new PMC content, do individual members of the NIPC need to be incorporated into the editorial workflow for PMC content?
3. Our original content outline had the first round of content being produced by Q2? Is this still feasible? "Value-based care" is the first time Jackie sent over for the webinar schedule.
