                    <h2>What's the most commonly cited issue with Life Preserver?</h2>
                    <h3 class="fragment"><em>People can't find it.</em></h3>
                    <h3 class="fragment">1 Year of Analytics <small>(May 1, 2015 - May 1, 2016)</small></h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li class="fragment important">1,211 pageviews (homepage)</li>
                        <li class="fragment important">858 pageviews (≈ 15 pages)</li>
                        <li class="fragment important">67% - 100% Bounce rates</li>
                    </ul>
                    <aside class="notes">
                        The most common shortcoming of Life Preserver cited by the NIPC is that the program has a low level of discoverability within the larger cap.org website, and, as a result, the content within LP gets very little traffic. Google analytics show all pages that fall underneath the homepage for Life Preserver received just 858 pageviews between May 1, 2015 and May 1, 2016, which speaks to the infrequent traffic to the resource. That said, the bounce rates, defined by frequency with which a user leaves the entire website from that page, are higher than the site average. So the question becomes: how can people find Life Preserver?

                    <h2>What about search?</h2>
                    <p>With "life preserver" as a search term on CAP.org:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li class="fragment">Life Preserver Homepage</li>

                    <aside class="notes">
                        One obvious answer is through site search. If we were to enter "life preserver" on cap.org's site search today, we get the following results. Not bad at all. This is a good sign: it shows that if end users are familiar with Life Preserver branding, they should be able to leverage cap.org site search to find LP content.

                        This isn't a bad thing; in fact, the rate with which our users rely on site search is higher than other large sites have even lower rates of site search usage. (Ref. if necessary: 1. AAP.org search, 2. 30% of end users on cap.org are new to the site.)
                        But search is <em>still important</em>, but not necessarily site search on cap.org. So our focus should be external search engines; namely, Google.

                    <h2>SEO Improvement #1: Titling</h2>
                    <h4 class="fragment">Use language that is human <em>and</em> machine readable. New titling is considered an easy win.</h4>

                        While search algorithms are incredibly robust, we need to accept that at the end of the day, search crawlers ("spiders") can only parse text, and they are typically not smart enough to discern complex linguistic concepts (eg, metaphors). One easy way to improve SEO is by changing our title. The following are just examples that I'd like you to keep in mind when we move to the third part of this section (ie, changing the title of Life Preserver).

                    <h2>SEO Improvement #2: Establish credibility</h2>
                    <p class="fragment">Check! Content on CAP.org will already be considered "credible" by external search engines because of the organization's reputation and status as a nonprofit.</p>
                    <aside class="notes">
                        Google does not reveal all the benchmarks used to improve relevancy, but there are currently over 200. One well-established piece of SEO currency is developing credibility. Luckily, cap.org already exceeds this benchmark because of our ties to the organization's scholarly publishing branch, links from other reputable sites, our high level of traffic, 501c status, etc.

                    <h2>SEO Improvement #3: Create <em>web-first</em> content</h2>
                    <p>Nielsen described PDFs as <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/pdf-unfit-for-human-consumption/">"unfit for human consumption"...</a></p>

                    <aside class="notes">
                        I cannot emphasize this enough. That said, "web-first" content does not require a high degree of technical proficiency. That said, we want to make sure the preferred, first-class citizen in terms of delivery medium is a webpage - this means fewer PDFs, Word documents, Excel spreadsheets, etc. While our current platform has limitations in this regard, we need to focus on a web- and content-first approach <em>before</em> we consider a potential replatform, rebranding, etc.

                        Lastly, we should keep users on our site. We don't want them to <em>bounce</em> like they usually do...to other sites, to PDFs, to print documents, etc. Now it's just a matter of creating content that keeps them around...

                        This brings me to my next point, which is the new editorial direction for Life Preserver, NIPC content, and the membership section of cap.org (and hopefully the entire cap.org website).
