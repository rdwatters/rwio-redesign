> Leading and/or participating in stakeholder and customer interviews to understand the business needs and users’ wants.

* My responsibilities as the Editor of AAP.org included consultations with dozens of stakeholders across multiple business units. 
* My current position as Digital Content Manager at the College of American Pathologists includes initial consultations with stakeholders as well, including highly engaged CAP members during semi-annual meetings across the country. 
* I've used a [core modeling worksheet](/samples/core-modeling.pdf) in both positions during kickoff and discovery meetings.

> Lead or support information architecture development; define content types to support content management system build; map content to the new site architecture and identify content gaps

* See screenshots of the [new sitemap][caporgsitemap], a small sample of the newly developed [content types][contenttypes], [CMS planning][cmsplanning] (with [field groups][fieldgroups]), and [data dictionary][datadictionary] for the re-platforming of cap.org from Oracle to Craft CMS.
* [Wireframes from a SharePoint 2010 project][sharepointwireframe], as well as [annotated wireframes][componentwireframes] to facilitate component-driven architecture and atomic design.  
* You can examples of an [editorial mission, content strategy statement, and content model][dstdocsedmission] I developed for the Digital Strategy Team's internal website.
* To demonstrate my passion for documentation and structured content&mdash;perhaps "obsession" is more apropros&mdash;you can also take a look at the [archetypes I developed][archetypes] as part of a complete reworking of a 500+ page redesign of a documentation site for the Hugo open source project.


> Content guidelines to clearly communicate audience, message, voice, tone and content presentation style to support a consistent website experience

* As Managing Medical Copy Editor at the AAP, I consolidated 5 internal style guides as an addendum to AMA 10. 
* You can also see a sample of the [CAP Digital Writers Guide](https://dst-temp.netlify.com/digital-writers-guide/) I've pushed to temporary hosting. The current/complete version of the site is available only via CAP network at http://digital.cap.org.

> Develop tagging strategy and taxonomy framework to dynamically relate content and provide client with the knowledge and tools they need to manage after launch

* See a screenshot of the new [cap.org taxonomy][caporgtaxonomy] or a PDF sample of a portion of the [taxonomies I developed for AAP.org][aaporgtaxonomies].

> Create a content development and migration plan that identifies content needs, resources and time estimates for content development and migration

* See the [content audit spreadsheet][aaporgaudit] I used as one step of the content migration process I developed for AAP.org.

> Develop content governance plans to support content management needs after launch

* As the Editor of AAP.org, I lead the governance cleanup project. **Note:** We worked with Rightpoint. :thumbsup:
* See also the [editorial process map][processmap] I developed as Managing Medical Copy Editor for the PREP line of subspecialty products. 



> Participating in client presentations and providing support materials for client presentations; providing insights and strategies for content marketing and SEO by developing relevant information based on users’ needs

* In 2016, I spent 15 weekends presenting to CAP committees across the country to encourage our highly engaged members to develop content under a new editorial model. 
    * You can [see an example of one of many presentations][phcpresentation] I gave to our Personalized Health Care committee in June 2017. 
* I've also conducted writing workshops for both PREP authors with the AAP and members of the CAP.

> Developing content management system training materials for content authors; training content authors how to use content management system

* As a Managing Medical Copy Editor with the AAP, I was responsible for training more than 100 pediatricians on how to use SharePoint 2010. 
* As the Editor of AAP.org, I was responsible for training three web content assistants in SharePoint 2013. 
* I built [extensive end user documentation][dstdocs] as part of the internal site I built for the Digital Strategy team.
* With Precision for Value, I worked with our IT to set up an SP2013 instance for better reference management. You can see a sample of the [training documentation][precisionwiki] I developed for my colleagues in Editorial Services. 
* Additionally, I've developed [content management and developer documentation wikis][capwiki] in the CAP's enterprise GitHub account.
* I'm passionate about technical and training documentation. See the new https://gohugo.io, which I completely reworked from the ground up with [more than 200k changes][hugocontribute] and completely revised site architecture. "User testing" included responding to 2000+ forum questions from end users over a 16-month period.
