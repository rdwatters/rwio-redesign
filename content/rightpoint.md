Chris,

Thanks so much for taking time out of your busy schedule to speak with me today. I've mapped a small selection of samples to the list of responsibilities from the [job description for the senior content strategist position][jobdescription]. I greatly look forward to further conversation on this position, your team, and Rightpoint as a whole.

&mdash; Ryan

## Responsibilities

> Leading and/or participating in stakeholder and customer interviews to understand the business needs and users’ wants.

My responsibilities as the Editor of AAP.org included consultations with dozens of stakeholders across multiple business units. My current position as Digital Content Manager at the College of American Pathologists includes initial consultations with stakeholders as well, including highly engaged CAP members. You can see an example of the [core modeling worksheet](/samples/core-modeling.pdf) I've used in both positions. 

> Lead or support information architecture development; define content types to support content management system build; map content to the new site architecture and identify content gaps

See screenshots of the [new sitemap][caporgsitemap], newly developed [content types][contenttypes], and [data dictionary][datadictionary] for the re-platforming of cap.org from Oracle to Craft CMS. To demonstrate my passion for structured content&mdash;perhaps "obsession" is more apropros&mdash;you can also take a look at the [archetypes I developed][archetypes] as part of a complete reworking of a 500+ page redesign of a documentation site for the Hugo open source project.

**Note:** I will provide screenshots of entity-relationship diagrams when I return to the office on Wednesday, July 26th.


> Content guidelines to clearly communicate audience, message, voice, tone and content presentation style to support a consistent website experience

I've developed multiple style guides. As Managing Medical Copy Editor at the AAP, I consolidated 5 internal style guides as an addendum to AMA 10. You can also see a sample of the [CAP Digital Writers Guide](https://dst-temp.netlify.com/digital-writers-guide/) I've pushed to temporary hosting. The current/complete version of the site is available only via CAP network at http://digital.cap.org.

> Develop tagging strategy and taxonomy framework to dynamically relate content and provide client with the knowledge and tools they need to manage after launch

See a screenshot of the new [cap.org taxonomy][caporgtaxonomy] or a PDF sample of the [taxonomies I developed for AAP.org][aaporgtaxonomies].

> Create a content development and migration plan that identifies content needs, resources and time estimates for content development and migration

See the [content audit spreadsheet][aaporgaudit] I used as one step of the content migration process I developed for AAP.org.

> Develop content governance plans to support content management needs after launch

As the Editor of AAP.org, I lead the governance cleanup. See also the [editorial process map][processmap] I developed as Managing Medical Copy Editor for the PREP line of subspecialty products. 

**Note:** I will provide a sample of the new governance document for cap.org once I return to the office on Wednesday, July 26th. 

> Participating in client presentations and providing support materials for client presentations; providing insights and strategies for content marketing and SEO by developing relevant information based on users’ needs

In 2016, I spent 15 weekends presenting to CAP committees across the country to encourage our highly engaged members to develop content under a new editorial model. You can see a sample [presentation I gave to our Personalized Health Care committee][phcpresentation] in June 2017. I've also conducted writing workshops for both PREP authors with the AAP and members of the CAP.

> Developing content management system training materials for content authors; training content authors how to use content management system

* As a Managing Medical Copy Editor with the AAP, I was responsible for training more than 100 pediatricians on how to use SharePoint 2010. 
* As the Editor of AAP.org, I was responsible for training three web content assistants in SharePoint 2013. 
* I built [extensive end user documentation][dstdocs] as part of the internal site I built for the Digital Strategy team.
* With Precision for Value, I worked with our IT to set up an SP2013 instance for better reference management. You can see a sample of the [training documentation][precisionwiki] I developed for my colleagues in Editorial Services. 
* Additionally, I've developed [content management and developer documentation wikis][capwiki] in the CAP's enterprise GitHub account.

To demonstrate my passion for technical and training documentation, you can also see the new https://gohugo.io, which I completely reworked from the ground up with [more than 200k changes][hugocontribute] and completely revised site architecture.
